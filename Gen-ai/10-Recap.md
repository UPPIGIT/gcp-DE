## Recap
Hello everyone and welcome back.

So guys, we covered many topics over the past few videos.

We talked about LMS.

We talked about embeddings, prompt engineering, fine tuning, and I explained to you all of these topics in detail in a very interactive way and by giving examples.

So now just to put all of that into a single view so that you are clear and you understand the whole

bigger picture, let's take a look at this video.

---

- **So a user like us types in a query on let's say ChatGPT.**

- **And it could actually be ChatGPT or Bard or llama, any large language model or that we saw.**

- **And what these LMS are, these are powerful generative models and they excel in generating text.**

- **And you will get output meaning your result.**

---

- **Now if we go deep into this large language model, the brain behind them is what is called as the neural**

- **network, more precisely, the transformers.**

- **In this case, they are trained on large volumes of data, and they convert text into embeddings to understand their semantics, meaning, context, etcetera.**

---

***Now, how can we improve further on these models, how we can get better results?**

**We can do two things.**

- **We can do something called as prompt engineering, which is simply a way of framing our questions better.**

- **We explain, we expand on them, we explain the background details so there is more understanding of
our question, and it gives us more pointed answer.**

**The second thing we can do is we can train our foundation model using domain or use case specific data**

- **set, and that is called as fine tuning.**

---

So this really is a summary of entire cycle of things. And these are universal concepts.
It's not like they hold true only for ChatGPT any in the world will follow all these concepts.
And that's why we talked about them much in depth in the past videos.
Technology guys is changing at a never before pace.
Every day new models are coming, computing power is increasing and you never know.
Maybe tomorrow some will replace ChatGPT as the most popular one.
That is why it is important to understand these fundamental concepts and not talk about one particular product.
That is why I kept this entire section in this course, and I explained everything to you in very simpledetail, with very interactive examples, so that you are clear.
Okay, so with this covered, let's move on.

Let's check out the next topic in the upcoming video.

Thank you.
