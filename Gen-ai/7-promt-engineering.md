# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Hello everyone and welcome back.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is a rapidly growing field with many new opportunities. It is a core component of generative AI, making it essential to include this topic in our course.

### What are Prompts?

A **prompt** is a specific question or input provided to an AI system to get a desired response. Here are some examples:

- Asking Alexa: *How is the weather?*
- Asking Siri: *Will it rain today?*
- Asking Google: *What is the recipe for a red velvet cake?*

In simple terms, whenever you give instructions or ask questions to an AI, you are using prompts.

### Examples of Prompts in Action

- Telling ChatGPT: *Summarize the key points of a research article.*
- Asking DALL-E: *Generate an image of a yellow car.*
- Using GitHub Copilot: *Write a Python program to add two numbers.*

We’ve all been using prompts, even without knowing the terminology.

## Understanding Prompt Engineering

Imagine asking a vague question like *"Tell me the weather in New York."* Without clear context, the response may not be helpful. However, if you ask, *"I’m going to New York this Saturday. How will the weather be?"* you’ll get a more specific and accurate answer.

### Key Takeaway:

If you ask clear, specific, and accurate questions while providing the correct context, you will receive better answers. This is the essence of **prompt engineering**.

## Live Examples of Prompt Engineering

1. **Generic Prompt:**
   - Question: *What is AI?*
   - Response: Generic, broad information.

2. **Refined Prompt:**
   - Question: *I am a healthcare professional. Explain AI with examples from healthcare.*
   - Response: Focused on healthcare with relevant examples, such as diagnostic tools and robotic surgery.

3. **Setting Context:**
   - Initial Prompt: *Imagine you are a news journalist writing about renewable energy. Use bullet points and keep responses under 500 words.*
   - Question: *Tell me about solar energy in the decade 2020–2030.*
   - Response: Detailed, bulleted, and specific to the context.

## Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

1. **Clearly Convey the Desired Response**
   - Specify if you need a summary, a detailed analysis, or bullet points.

2. **Provide Context or Background Information**
   - Example: *I am a healthcare professional...* sets the context and keeps answers relevant.

3. **Balance Simplicity and Complexity**
   - Avoid overly generic or overly complex prompts. Keep them balanced.

4. **Iterative Testing and Refinement**
   - Crafting effective prompts is an art. Test and refine your prompts for the best results.

## Challenges in Prompt Engineering

1. **Inconsistent Results**
   - Small changes in wording can lead to vastly different responses.

2. **Overloading the Prompt**
   - Including too many details can confuse the AI and result in poor responses.

### Conclusion

Prompt engineering is a powerful way to improve AI interactions without requiring coding skills. By crafting better questions, you get more accurate, relevant, and useful answers.

Remember: Prompt engineering is both an art and a science. Refine your prompts iteratively to achieve the best results!
